# PQLines
A cross-platform mobile app developed for displaying key safety information to energy transmission service staff. Simple in it's functionality, but with a relatively well-formed code base

## Tech Base

- Xamarin.Forms
- .NET / C#

## Targeted Devices

- Android
- iOS

## Code Design

Adhered to SOLID design principles, with assistance from Autofac implementation providing IoC and DI.

## Limitations

- Certain graphics have been ommited since original app deployment for confidentiality reasons
- Since original app deployment, the app had a dependency on Xamarin Components which are no longer supported, so an implemented iOS dependent theme has been explicitly removed. The app may not render properly on iOS devices.
